SensorID (plane position) comments

Before 2016:
------------

chip55 (0)  HR10
chip66 (1)  HR10
chip67 (2)  HR10
chip72b (3) HR10
chip69 (4)  HR15
chip81 (5)  HR20

September 2015:
---------------
chip69 (4) chip69 shows high stand-by current 800mA instead of 350mA (incl. AUX board)
chip81 (5) exchanged to have a homogenous HR10 telescope

January 2016:
-------------

chip55 (0) HR10
chip66 (1) HR10
chip67 (2) HR10
chip72 (3) HR10 (chip72b just renamed)
chip62 (4) HR10 (new)
chip59 (5) HR10 (new)

June 2016:
----------

observation at CERN / in ELab4, August 2016

chip67 (2) shows high stand-by current 700mA instead of 350mA (incl. AUX board) / confirmed plus fluctuating current between 600-940mA, "fluctuating picture", no stable clock/synchronization
chip72 (3) shows plus 200mA in operation, 6 JTAG errors, parts of the sensor show no data / Matrix C is half-dead, Matrix D is dead = no output
chip59 (5) high current, fluctuation / high current 0.8-1.2A, 1st JTAG is working, 2nd not plus unstable current

July 2016:
----------

chip55 (0) HR10
chip66 (1) HR10
chip81 (2) HR20 (new)
chip68 (3) HR20 (new)
chip62 (4) HR10
chip57 (5) HR10 (new)

Commissioning succesful: No JTAG errors, running current at 3.66A, data seems to be good.
